## Displaying Toronto's Collision Data in a Hexbin Map

This project contains a web map built with Mapbox GL JS and turf.js showing Toronto's collision data in a hexbin map. Collision point data was aggregated into each bin and displayed on the map.

Please access the web map [here](https://mia0204.github.io/ggr472-lab4/).

## Data Sources

## Interactivity
