## Displaying Toronto's Collision Data in a Hexbin Map

This project contains a web map built with Mapbox GL JS and turf.js showing Toronto's collision data in a hexbin map. Collision point data was aggregated into each bin and displayed on the map.

## Interactivity

- Pop-ups on hover for each collision point displaying more details.  
- Geocoder for searching locations within Toronto area.
- Checkbox based filter to turn collision point layer on and off to enhance the readability of the map.
